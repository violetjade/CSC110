          <p>This is a category of food that has cultural roots in Asia, particularly South Asia. It is a dish with a spiced sauce or gravy base, with endless amounts of variety. Intense depth of flavor is the standard, and it's what makes each kind so delicious no matter the specific add-ins. This customizability makes it simple to make compatible with a diet free of animal products. Curries are commonly served with a starchy staple such as rice or naan (flatbread).</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The first image shows aloo palak, probably my favorite curry I've ever had. Its primary ingredients are spinach, potatoes, and onion.</li>
            <li>A daal tadka is pictured second, which is a yellow lentil and tomato curry.</li>
            <li>The third picture displays an easy curry that I make often, made mostly of chickpeas, coconut milk, and tomato.</li>

          <p>The dish known as chili con carne from Mexico has grown to be so popular in America that it is usally abbreviated as just "chili". The "chili" of course refers to the chili peppers traditionally used in its preparation. It has grown to be one of my favorites because of how easy it can be to make and, particularly, veganize. It being so bean-forward is very compatible with my love for legumes.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Displayed on the far left is a simple bean and vegetable chili which is similar to one that I prepare often.</li>
            <li>The second image shows a dish that I love to make as a fun twist: chili mac and cheese. I often just mix in a boxed instant vegan mac with my homemade chili, but following a recipe can be interesting once in a while.</li>
            <li>On the far right, a beanless chili is shown. I don't normally forego beans for my chili, but every so often it could be enjoyable.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This highly popular Italian food is a staple even in the United States. It is used as a base for many kinds of dishes, usually ones that incorporate a sauce with various add-ins. The plethora of shape options it comes in makes it especially fun as a food. It is often naturally vegan (when made without eggs) and very affordable, so it is a go-to for my cooking. One of my favorite things to do with cooking is to try a new pasta recipe, which is often as easy as switching up sauce ingredients to make new combinations.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The first picture is a dish that combines 2 of my favorite things: hummus and pasta. This hummus pasta recipe changed my life for the better and I make it usually at least once a month, usually more. I often sub in different kinds of hummus flavors to experiment.</li>
            <li>Displayed second here is an image of lasagna. I love lasagna because it is customizable, and all of the layers make it very filling. My favorite lasagna ingredients include tofu ricotta, spinach, vegan mozarella, a good tomato sauce, and sometimes a vegan mince meat.</li>
            <li>An alfredo is displayed last in this lineup. Trying out different types of plant milk as a base for the sauce can be fun, but this one is specifically made with coconut milk, which I have found to be the best, in my opinion.</li>

          <p>Bread is one of the world's favorite foods, as basically every culture across the globe has some sort of bread in their cuisine. Dough made with flour and water is the only requirement to consider something bread, so there are countless options for making it into a unique kind of bread, just by changing the preparation process or by cooking it differently or by adding other ingredients. While people usually pair bread with other foods to eat it, such as sandwiches, I honestly love bread so much that I will eat it plain.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A loaf of sourdough is pictured first. The specific flavor of sourdough is so special and I will often go for it over other more basic breads.</li>
            <li>Displayed in the middle is a sweet bread, banana bread. I love freezing bananas so that I can have some available to make banana bread whenever.</li>
            <li>Pizza, pictured last, counts as (sort of) bread to me. It is just a dish that primarily features bread, so I of course love it. The best pizzas are ones with thick crust. My favorite toppings include banana peppers, green bell peppers, mushrooms, and vegan pepperoni.</li>

          <p>This highly favored confectionary made from processing cacao seeds is found in all sorts of candy and desserts. While it can be consumed in its naturally bitter form without anything added, usually people enjoy it with sweet ingredients mixed in. My personal preference is darker chocolate, with more cacao and less sweeteners. It can be eaten by itself as the basic chocolate confectionary, but it is also used as an ingredient in other dishes. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The image displayed first below shows one of my favorite store-bought chocolate bars. 50-70% is the sweet spot for cacao content in chocolate I like eating.</li>
            <li>The picture in the middle displays a chocolate mug cake recipe that I prepare regularly. When I'm craving a lot of chocolate, I'll make this simple mug cake in under 10 minutes in the microwave.</li>
            <li>The final image in this lineup pictures a brownie. Brownies are a classic chocolate treat, and I can't help but love them like most other people.</li>
